This directory contains tiny additional programs which you might just like
or need to run BitlBee:

* bitlbeed.c

If you want to run BitlBee on a machine you don't have root access to, this
utility will help you. Compiling it is easy: 'gcc bitlbeed.c -o bitlbeed',
you don't need any special flags. Use 'bitlbeed -h' to get more help.

For example, 'bitlbeed -p6669 -n1 /home/wilmer/bin/bitlbee' will start
listening on TCP port 6669 (on any interface, you might not want that!)
and connect the specified BitlBee program to this socket as soon as
someone connects. (The -n1 makes sure only one person can be connected
at once.)

Of course this program can be used for other programs too, not just BitlBee.

* create_nicksfile.pl (Christian Friedl <christian.friedl@chello.at>)

This program reads your ~/.licq/ configuration data and convert it to a
correct .nicks file. This program can be extended to read other contact
list file formats as well.

* bitlbee-daemon.patch (Maurits Dijkstra <mauritsd@xs4all.nl>)

With this patch, you can run BitlBee as a stand-alone daemon (without
inetd). Because for now we don't think the program is stable enough to
serve all users in one single process, we haven't applied the patch to
the main source tree but put it here instead. If you'd like to have this
funtionality anyway you can apply this patch and read the help
information. (run the binary with a -h argument.)

NOTE: We haven't been able to update this patch for 0.84 in time, so if
you need this patch, please check if it's available from
http://get.bitlbee.org/patches/

* Dynamic MOTD for BitlBee (Geert Hauwaerts <geert@hauwaerts.be>)

Originally, I wanted to put this program here, but Geert put it online
on his own server, with docs and stuff, so I guess it's better to put
a link here. dmotd is a little script which generates a motd with some
nice statistics, especially nice for servers with many people on it.

See http://dmotd.hauwaerts.be/ and the MOTD of msn.irssi.org for more
information.


Please do send me your sources if you write anything useful for the Bee!
