This directory contains tiny additional programs which you might just like
or need to run BitlBee:

* bitlbeed.c

If you want to run BitlBee on a machine you don't have root access to, this
utility will help you. Compiling it is easy: 'gcc bitlbeed.c -o bitlbeed',
you don't need any special flags. Use 'bitlbeed -h' to get more help.

For example, 'bitlbeed -p6669 -n1 /home/wilmer/bin/bitlbee' will start
listening on TCP port 6669 (on any interface, you might not want that!)
and connect the specified BitlBee program to this socket as soon as
someone connects. (The -n1 makes sure only one person can be connected
at once.)

Of course this program can be used for other programs too, not just BitlBee.

* create_nicksfile.pl (Christian Friedl <christian.friedl@chello.at>)

This program reads your ~/.licq/ configuration data and convert it to a
correct .nicks file.


Please do send me your sources if you write anything useful for the Bee!
