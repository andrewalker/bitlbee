Frequently Asked Questions about BitlBee
========================================

Well, maybe not exactly "Frequently", but definately "Asked" ... mostly by
the developers :-)

Q: WTH were you guys on when you thought of that _weird_ name?
A: Though we live in The Netherlands and one of us even lives in Amsterdam,
   we're not on drugs ... most of the time.

Q: Okay, so the cops are so evil there, you can't even admit the truth, but
   WTH does BitlBee mean then?
A: There are a few explanations. But the most symbolical goes like: the two
   colors of the bee symbolize the two worlds betwee which the Bee flies. On
   the one hand there's the IM-networks, on the other is IRC.
   
   Truth be told, it's absolute nonsense. The biggest nutcase in the
   development team just played around with words for half an hour or so.
   BitlBee was the result. We liked it, we kept it. We lovingly shorten it
   to "the Bee" or even "het Bijtje" (Dutch for "the little Bee") sometimes.

Q: What is 'root' doing in my control channel? I didn't start the Bee as
   root.
A: 'root' is just the name for the most powerful user in BitlBee. Just like
   in the system, it is root who is the ... eh ... root of the
   functionality. Luckily, in BitlBee, root follows your orders (mostly), so
   no BOFHs there.
   
   We get some complaints from time to time that 'root' is a confusing name.
   Because of that name, some package maintainers have renamed root to, for
   example, BitlBee. We recognize that some people see that need. If the
   package maintainer hasn't renamed root, you can do this yourself with the
   'rename' command.
   
   The name root is not likely to change in the 'official' releases, though.
   We find the metaphor of root correct and feel that there is no important
   (security threatening) reason to change this non-creative piece of
   artistic creativity.

Q: Why is there no mailing list/CVS/<insert your favourite development tool
   here>?
A: Short answer: we don't need it.
   
   Longer answer: and we're not completely convinced of their merits.
   
   Long answer: we currently use some shell scripts which make sure all
   developers' copies are in sync with Wilmer's master copy. These shell
   scripts also produce development "releases" and packages, as well as
   stick them on a http-server. Patches are sent to Wilmer who decides
   whether or not a patch should be applied and if it may need some
   additional changes. This has the consistency advantage of a one-person
   project while having the capacity of more people available. The system
   works and we are kind of attached to it.

Q: Why doesn't BitlBee reconnect to IM-networks automatically when a
   connection fails?
A: Because we don't want it to. We think it can be a bit dangerous, for
   example for protocols which don't allow you to log in more than once
   on the same account.
   
   Also, is it really that bad not to be online on MSN/ICQ/whatever when
   you're away from your keyboard anyway? Typing "account on" is enough
   to bring all the lost connections back up, which is good enough for us.
   
   If you feel like writing a patch which adds this auto-reconnect stuff,
   you're welcome to write one. We're not going to take the time to implement
   it, but good patches will never be rejected.
