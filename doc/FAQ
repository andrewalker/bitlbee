Frequently Asked Questions about BitlBee
========================================

Well, maybe not exactly "Frequently", but definitely "Asked" ... mostly by
the developers :-)

Q: WTH were you guys on when you thought of that _weird_ name?
A: Though we live in The Netherlands and one of us even lives in Amsterdam,
   we're not on drugs ... most of the time.

Q: Okay, so the cops are so evil there, you can't even admit the truth, but
   WTH does BitlBee mean then?
A: There are a few explanations. But the most symbolical goes like: the two
   colors of the bee symbolize the two worlds betwee which the Bee flies. On
   the one hand there's the IM-networks, on the other is IRC.
   
   Truth be told, it's absolute nonsense. The biggest nutcase in the
   development team just played around with words for half an hour or so.
   BitlBee was the result. We liked it, we kept it. We lovingly shorten it
   to "the Bee" or even "het Bijtje" (Dutch for "the little Bee") sometimes.

Q: What is 'root' doing in my control channel? I didn't start the Bee as
   root.
A: 'root' is just the name for the most powerful user in BitlBee. Just like
   in the system, it is root who is the ... eh ... root of the
   functionality. Luckily, in BitlBee, root follows your orders (mostly), so
   no BOFHs there.
   
   We get some complaints from time to time that 'root' is a confusing name.
   Because of that name, some package maintainers have renamed root to, for
   example, BitlBee. We recognize that some people see that need. If the
   package maintainer hasn't renamed root, you can do this yourself with the
   'rename' command.
   
   The name root is not likely to change in the 'official' releases, though.
   We find the metaphor of root correct and feel that there is no important
   (security threatening) reason to change this non-creative piece of
   artistic creativity.

Q: Why is there no mailing list/CVS/<insert your favourite development tool
   here>?
A: Short answer: we don't need it.
   
   Longer answer: and we're not completely convinced of their merits.
   
   Long answer: we currently use some shell scripts which make sure all
   developers' copies are in sync with Wilmer's master copy. These shell
   scripts also produce development "releases" and packages, as well as
   stick them on a http-server. Patches are sent to Wilmer who decides
   whether or not a patch should be applied and if it may need some
   additional changes. This has the consistency advantage of a one-person
   project while having the capacity of more people available. The system
   works and we are kind of attached to it.

Q: Why doesn't BitlBee reconnect to IM-networks automatically when a
   connection fails?
A: Because we don't want it to. We think it can be a bit dangerous, for
   example for protocols which don't allow you to log in more than once
   on the same account.
   
   Also, is it really that bad not to be online on MSN/ICQ/whatever when
   you're away from your keyboard anyway? Typing "account on" is enough
   to bring all the lost connections back up, which is good enough for us.
   
   If you feel like writing a patch which adds this auto-reconnect stuff,
   you're welcome to write one. We're not going to take the time to implement
   it, but good patches will never be rejected.
   
   -- A patch was submitted some time ago, it's imported now. See
      "help set auto_reconnect" for more information.

Q: When is $random_feature going to be implemented?
A: Please do consult doc/TODO before asking. You're not going to be the
   first one to ask for file transfer support. ;-) Please also check the
   documentation. You'd also not be the first one to request a feature
   which already exists!
   
   If your fabulous feature seems not to be requested before, just join
   #bitlbee on irc.oftc.net and tell us the news.

Q: What about MSN Messenger support?
A: At least until 15 October 2003 it will be supported. We don't know what
   will happen after that, when Microsoft closes all the pre-protocol-9
   clients from their network. We're certainly *not* going to pay for (or
   put our name/signature under) a Microsoft License Agreement, because
   that's probably going to be some kind of NDA or yet another "Open
   Source equals Devil" document. Not to mention paying for it...
   
   As soon as we get more information about the new protocol (it is said
   that it's not much more than a new authentication method), support might
   come. Just don't be surprised to see MSN support disappear completely.
   We're not really going to miss it, sorry.
   
   We just suggest you to set your "friendly name" to something like
   "Wilmer - I won't be here anymore after 15 October 2003, so please do
   speak up if you still have anything important to tell."... ;-)
   
   Most MSN-clone developers seem to be quite optimistic about the situation.
   The new authentication method they implemented might be enough to keep
   working after 15 October 2003. But we can't be sure about that.
   
   In short, it won't work for a while. If possible, we'll fix it. If that's
   not possible, bad luck...
