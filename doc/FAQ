Frequently Asked Questions about BitlBee
========================================

Well, maybe not exactly "Frequently", but definitely "Asked" ... mostly by
the developers :-)

Q: WTH were you guys on when you thought of that _weird_ name?
A: Though we live in The Netherlands and one of us even lives in Amsterdam,
   we're not on drugs ... most of the time.

Q: Okay, so the cops are so evil there, you can't even admit the truth, but
   WTH does BitlBee mean then?
A: There are a few explanations. But the most symbolical goes like: the two
   colors of the bee symbolize the two worlds betwee which the Bee flies. On
   the one hand there's the IM-networks, on the other is IRC.
   
   Truth be told, it's absolute nonsense. The biggest nutcase in the
   development team just played around with words for half an hour or so.
   BitlBee was the result. We liked it, we kept it. We lovingly shorten it
   to "the Bee" or even "het Bijtje" (Dutch for "the little Bee") sometimes.

Q: What is 'root' doing in my control channel? I didn't start the Bee as
   root.
A: 'root' is just the name for the most powerful user in BitlBee. Just like
   in the system, it is root who is the ... eh ... root of the
   functionality. Luckily, in BitlBee, root follows your orders (mostly), so
   no BOFHs there.
   
   We get some complaints from time to time that 'root' is a confusing name.
   Because of that name, some package maintainers have renamed root to, for
   example, BitlBee. We recognize that some people see that need. If the
   package maintainer hasn't renamed root, you can do this yourself with the
   'rename' command.
   
   The name root is not likely to change in the 'official' releases, though.
   We find the metaphor of root correct and feel that there is no important
   (security threatening) reason to change this non-creative piece of
   artistic creativity.

Q: Why is there no mailing list/CVS/<insert your favourite development tool
   here>?
A: Short answer: we don't need it.
   
   Longer answer: and we're not completely convinced of their merits.
   
   Long answer: we currently use some shell scripts which make sure all
   developers' copies are in sync with Wilmer's master copy. These shell
   scripts also produce development "releases" and packages, as well as
   stick them on a http-server. Patches are sent to Wilmer who decides
   whether or not a patch should be applied and if it may need some
   additional changes. This has the consistency advantage of a one-person
   project while having the capacity of more people available. The system
   works and we are kind of attached to it.

Q: When is $random_feature going to be implemented?
A: Please do consult doc/TODO before asking. You're not going to be the
   first one to ask for file transfer support. ;-) Please also check the
   documentation. You'd also not be the first one to request a feature
   which already exists!
   
   If your fabulous feature seems not to be requested before, just join
   #bitlbee on irc.oftc.net and tell us the news.

Q: Will MSN ever work again?
A: In theory: Yes. Gaim still works, so with some efforts those fixes should
   be portable to BitlBee. That's going to be quite a lot of work though.
   
   Unfortunately Microsoft is threatening with the DMCA to anyone who
   touches "their protocol". Probably not a big issue, but certainly not
   something we want to have trouble with. Even though the local
   European/Dutch law allows reverse-engineering for interoperability, we
   don't feel like being banned from the USA, especially not by Microsoft.
   </paranoid>
   
   Anyway, ATM backporting changes from Gaim would be a waste because the
   current IM-system used by BitlBee is about to be ditched in favour of
   something new/better, which means all the efforts put into a fix would
   be wasted. We know we've been saying this for ages, but this time we
   really mean it! ;-)
   
   And as always, if you do feel like spending your time on this, go ahead
   and write a patch. We'll see what we can do. Let's hope DMCA doesn't
   prohibit our site to link to your patch. Oh, sorry, I promised to stop
   being paranoid eh?
