INSTALLATION
============

If you installed BitlBee from a .deb or .rpm you probably don't have to do
anything anymore for installation.

If you want to compile BitlBee yourself, that's fine. If you want BitlBee
to look up hosts in /etc/hosts.{allow,deny} you have to install Wietse
Venema's TCP wrapper libraries. (But BitlBee works perfectly without
them.) Then you can run ./configure to set up the build system. If
configure succeeds, run make to build BitlBee. make install will move all
the files to the right places.

After installation you have to set up inetd (you got that one running,
right?) to start BitlBee. You need to add BitlBee to inetd.conf, like so:

6667    stream  tcp     nowait nobody /usr/sbin/bitlbee bitlbee

Creating a special BitlBee user and running BitlBee with that UID might be
a good idea.

Also, don't forget to create the configuration directory (/var/lib/bitlbee/
by default) and chown it to the uid BitlBee is running as.


BACKGROUNDS
===========

We are both console lovers. But it is annoying to have a few tty's open with
chat things in them. IRC, ICQ, MSN, Jabber... For X there is Gaim, which
supports many chatprotocols. Why wasn't there such a thing for the console?

The idea to port Gaim was easily thought of, of course. But we liked our IRC
clients. And we used it the most, so we used it best. Importing it into the
IRC client was a nice idea. But what if someone liked a different client.
Then (s)he had to duplicate our work.

That's a shame, we thought. Doing work twice is pointless. So when Wilmer
got the ingenious thought in his mind while farming, to create an IRC to
other chatnetworks gateway, we were both so excited, that we started working
on it almost immediately. And the result is BitlBee.

A NOTE ON ENCRYPTION
====================

BitlBee stores the accounts and settings (not your contact list though) in
some sort of encrypted/obfuscated format.

*** THIS IS NOT A SAFE FORMAT! ***

You should still make sure the rights to the configuration directory and
files are set so that only root and the BitlBee user can read/write them.

This format is not to prevent malicicous users from running with your
passwords, but to prevent accidental glimpses of the administrators to cause
any harm. You have no choice but to trust root though.
