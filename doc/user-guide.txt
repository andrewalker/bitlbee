Chapter 1. Installation

Downloading the package

The latest BitlBee release is always available from http://www.bitlbee.org/.
Download the package with your favorite program and unpack it: tar xvfz
bitlbee-<version>.tar.gz where <version> is to be replaced by the version
number of the BitlBee you downloaded (e.g. 0.73, 0.74a, 0.80).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compiling

BitlBee's build system has to be configured before compiling. The configure
script will do this for you. Just run it, it'll set up with nice and hopefully
well-working defaults. If you want to change some settings, just try ./
configure --help and see what you can do.

Some variables that might be of interest to the normal user:

  * config - The place where BitlBee will save settings for all the users. /var
    /lib/bitlbee/ is the default value.
   
  * tcpd - If you enable this one, you can specify what hosts should be allowed
    to use your BitlBee by editting /etc/hosts.deny and/or /etc/hosts.deny.
   
After running configure, you should run make. After that, run make install as
root.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuration

By default, BitlBee runs as the user nobody. You might want to run it as a
seperate user (some computers run named or apache as nobody).

Since BitlBee uses inetd, you should add the following line to /etc/inetd.conf:

6667    stream  tcp     nowait nobody /usr/local/sbin/bitlbee bitlbee

Inetd has to be restarted after changing the configuration. Either killall -HUP
inetd or /etc/init.d/inetd restart should do the job on most systems.

You might be one of the.. ehr, lucky people running an xinetd-powered distro. 
xinetd is quite different and they seem to be proud of that.. ;-) Anyway, if
you want BitlBee to work with xinetd, just copy the bitlbee.xinetd file to your
/etc/xinetd.d/ directory (and probably edit it to suit your needs).

You should create a directory where BitlBee can store it's data files. This
should be the directory named after the value 'CONFIG' in Makefile.settings.
The default is /var/lib/bitlbee, which can be created with the command mkdir -p
/var/lib/bitlbee. This directory has to be owned by the user that runs bitlbee.
To make 'nobody' owner of this directory, run chown nobody /var/lib/bitlbee.
Because things like passwords are saved in this directory, it's probably a good
idea to make this directory owner-read-/writable only.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 2. Usage

Connecting to the server

Since BitlBee acts just like any other irc daemon, you can connect to it with
your favorite irc client. Launch it and connect to localhost port 6667 (or
whatever host/port you are running bitlbee on).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The #bitlbee control channel

Once you are connected to the BitlBee server, you are automatically joined to #
bitlbee on that server. This channel acts like the 'buddy list' you have on the
various other chat networks.

The user 'root' always hangs around in #bitlbee and acts as your interface to
bitlbee. All commands you give on #bitlbee are 'answered' by root.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Commands

BitlBee can be configured by giving 'commands' in the #bitlbee channel. 'root'
responds to these commands. Use the command 'help' to retrieve a list of
commands bitlbee supports with syntax. You can get an up-to-date list of
available commands using the help commands command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Talking to people

You can talk to by starting a query with them. In most irc clients, this can be
done with either /msg <nick> <text> or /query <nick>.

To keep the number of open query windows limited, you can also talk to people
in the control channel, like <nick>: <text>.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 3. Support

BitlBee is beta software

Although BitlBee has quite some functionality it is still beta. That means it
can crash at any time, corrupt your data or whatever. Don't use it in any
production environment and don't rely on it.
