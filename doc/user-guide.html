Download the package with your favorite program and unpack it: <B

xvfz bitlbee-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz</B

replaced by the version number of the BitlBee you downloaded (e.g. 0.73,

Anyway, if you want BitlBee to work with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>xinetd</B
>, just copy the
bitlbee.xinetd file to your /etc/xinetd.d/ directory (and probably edit it to suit
your needs).</P
><P
>You should create a directory where BitlBee can store it's data files. This 
should be the directory named after the value 'CONFIG' in Makefile.settings. 
The default is <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/lib/bitlbee</TT
>, which can be created 
with the command <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mkdir -p /var/lib/bitlbee</B
>. This 
directory has to be owned by the user that runs bitlbee. To make 
'nobody' owner of this directory, run <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>chown nobody /var/lib/bitlbee</B
>.
Because things like passwords are saved in this directory, it's probably
a good idea to make this directory owner-read-/writable only.</P
