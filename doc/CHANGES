Version 0.72:
- Updated the documentation.
- Improved the MSN friendlyname code. (Although it doesn't seem to be perfect
  yet..)
- info-command added to get more information about ICQ users.
- blist-command added to get a complete buddy list.
- Fixed a bug which broke the AIM code when adding a screenname with a space
  in it.
- Added the NS alias for the NICKSERV command (Tony Vroon).
- Fixed the USERHOST command implementation (Tony Vroon).
- /me from IM-networks is now converted to a CTCP ACTION correctly.
- Added an utils/ directory with some misc toys and handy things.
- Added a /notice to the on_typing event. Don't use it though, the /notice
  flood will just be a big annoyance. ;-)
- Some people like root and themself to be ops, some don't. Now it's
  configurable. (set ops)
- Now the umode stuff actually works. Next step: Use those modes... (How?)

Version 0.71:
- Fixed the help command output layout (alignment)
- Added a sample xinetd file
- Cleaned up, 0.70 released with a build-stamp and DEADJOE file (oops)..
- Messages can be sent like '<user>, <message>' in the control channel now,
  instead of just '<user>: <message>'
- Added a debug setting boolean: Set it to true for some debugging crap
  which used to be on by default..
- Changed the /whois reply: In the server section you know see the
  connection this user belongs to.
- Added some root/permission checks.
- configure script works correctly when the terminating / is forgotten for
  a directory.
- Fixed format string bug in protocols/oscar/meta.c (Hmm, what's the use of
  that file?)
- Added '#include "crypting.h"' to commands.c to get rid of stupid warnings
- Fixed crash-bug (SIGSEGV when adding an @-less contact to MSN/Jabber)
- Added to_char setting
- Fixed bug in set.c: It ignored the new value returned by the evaluator
  :-(
- Removed protocol tag from 'hostname' in user hostmask because this info
  is in /whois' server section now
- Added the GPL. Somehow 0.7 released without a COPYING file.. :-/
- Enhanced the root_command() parser, you can 'quote' "arguments" now so
  arguments can be strings with spaces
- Debugging versions have True as the default value for set debug
- NICKSERV is now an alternative for PRIVMSG root. This does not affect
  functionality of current NICKSERV commands, but does allow people to just
  do identify <pass> in channel.
- NICKSERV REGISTER now doesn't try to log you in (to check if the user
  exists) but checks for the existence of the user-configuration files.
- NICKSERV SET password now works (as does set password in channel). This
  makes changing your password possible.
- NICKSERV password now stored in irc_t.
- ./configure now only bugs you about possible problems with strip if it's
  actually going to strip (wooohoooo! _sexy_ :)
- Fixed a load of warnings in oscar.c, irc.c, nick.c and set.c
- Split up root_command() into a version which eats raw strings and one
  which eats split strings
- New help system: Help available for most (all?) commands, all read from
  an external help-file.
- Changed the maximum message length in irc_usermsg() from IRC_MAX_LINE to
  1024 (for loooong help messages..).
- Only allow user to set supported umodes.
- Fixed a memory leak in crypting.c (Thanks to Erik Hensema.)
- Added a send_handler callback to user_t. Needed for the following entry:
- Added the NickServ user as a root-clone.
- Disabled tcpd by default because it's just a PITA for a lot of systems
  and because you can use /usr/sbin/tcpd as well.
- The root user can be renamed now.
