<title>Downloading the package</title>

<para>
The latest BitlBee release is always available from <ulink
url="http://www.lintux.cx/bitlbee.html">http://www.lintux.cx/bitlbee.html</ulink>.
Download the package with your favorite program and unpack it: <command>tar
xvfz bitlbee-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz</command> where &lt;version&gt; is to be
replaced by the version number of the BitlBee you downloaded (e.g. 0.73,
0.74a, 0.80).
</para>

<title>Compiling</title>
<para>
BitlBee's build system has to be configured before compiling. The
<filename>configure</filename> script will do this for you. Just run
it, it'll set up with nice and hopefully well-working defaults. If you
want to change some settings, just try
<command>./configure --help</command> and see what you can do.
</para>

<para>Some variables that might be of interest to the normal user:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>config - The place where BitlBee will save settings for
all the users. <filename>/var/lib/bitlbee/</filename> is the default
value.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>tcpd - If you enable this one, you can specify what hosts
should be allowed to use your BitlBee by editting
<filename>/etc/hosts.deny</filename> and/or <filename>/etc/hosts.deny</filename>.
</itemizedlist>

<para>
After running <filename>configure</filename>, you should run
<command>make</command>. After that, run <command>make install</command> as 
root.

<title>Configuration</title>

<para>
By default, BitlBee runs as the user nobody. You might want 
to run it as a seperate user (some computers run named or apache as nobody). 
</para>

<para>
Since BitlBee uses inetd, you should add the following line to <filename>/etc/inetd.conf</filename>:
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
6667    stream  tcp     nowait nobody /usr/local/sbin/bitlbee bitlbee
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
Inetd has to be restarted after changing the configuration. Either
<command>killall -HUP inetd</command> or 
<command>/etc/init.d/inetd restart</command> should do the job on most systems.
</para>

<para>
You might be one of the.. ehr, lucky people running an xinetd-powered distro.
<command>xinetd</command> is quite different and they seem to be proud of that.. ;-)
Anyway, if you want BitlBee to work with <command>xinetd</command>, just copy the
bitlbee.xinetd file to your /etc/xinetd.d/ directory (and probably edit it to suit
your needs).
</para>

<para>
You should create a directory where BitlBee can store it's data files. This 
should be the directory named after the value 'CONFIG' in Makefile.settings. 
The default is <filename>/var/lib/bitlbee</filename>, which can be created 
with the command <command>mkdir -p /var/lib/bitlbee</command>. This 
directory has to be owned by the user that runs bitlbee. To make 
'nobody' owner of this directory, run <command>chown nobody /var/lib/bitlbee</command>.
Because things like passwords are saved in this directory, it's probably
a good idea to make this directory owner-read-/writable only.
